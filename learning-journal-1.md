# Learning Journal 1

Yesterday was a complicated day, I have just changed to a MAC so a bit of a learning curve.
Today we had a good lab, I learned a lot working with Gregor, he really knows his stuff.
I feel like we need a separate lecture just on GIT. Understand working with media rules a bit better.
