# Learning Journal 7

We have learned how to create databases and how to create tables inside them.
we deployed a backend on Heroku and got our front end, which is on git pages, to talk to our back end.
It is very challenging, what we have done the last two days, but I am enjoying it. I feel like I have learned more than in previous weeks.
